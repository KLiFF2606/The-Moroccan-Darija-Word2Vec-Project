### The word to vector project.

This is the main folder of our project.

The training is base on an other open source project 'gensim' (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) which provides the algorithms that train the word to vector model.

The models folder contains the released models. They are pre-trained models and some of them can be further trained with new vocabulary.

The datasets folder contains training and test datasets.
