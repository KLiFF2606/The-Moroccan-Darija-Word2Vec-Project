# The-Moroccan-Darija-Word2Vec-Project
The Moroccan Darija Word Embedding project is an open-source project that aims to create a large word embedding database for Moroccan Darija.

(You don't know what is a word embedding database? No problem you can find all you need here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding)

## Why do we build such a component?

Moroccan Darija is being more and more used by moroccan Internet users. Writing tweets in Darija is now a trend and will soon become the rule. Many pages and groups on facebook are increasignly using Darija as their main writing language. Finally, almost all WhatsApp conversations are written in Darija using arabic letters. The usage of mobile apps allows more ease of use with the arabic keyword available on almost every smartphone.

Therefore, it becomes obvious that building an effective NLP algorithm for moroccan Internet users has to target Darija.

Word embedding (word to vector for instance) can be considered as the first building stone to any successfful NLP algorithm. It allows machine learning algorithms to input a word representation that reflects a learned pseudo-meaning. This is proven to remarquably improve the performance of algorithms used for tasks like sentiment analysis, entity detection, etc..

For many languages, word to vector databases have already been built and are available for free on Internet. Some of them contain billions of tokens. Also, a database already exists for Classical Arabic and none exists yet for Moroccan Darija.

For any NLP professional, researcher or student, the lack of such a database is simply a concrete wall ahead of any NLP project. For the industry, it means a whole set of capabilities to forget.

For us, the lack of such a database is an opportunity to gather a new moroccan generation of AI enthousiats arround a common project and get all the benefits from building it.

### A note about The Darija challenge
With the increasing interest on using Darija comes a challenge. There is not one Darija and not everyone writes Darija the same way. Building the word to vector from a very large data set solves this issue. The more words (or more accurately tokens) it contains to more spellings it handles.

## Who can help?
### Data providers
We currently need to gather every Darija sentence we can find. Our priority is sentences that are written in arabic letters. If you are the owner of large sets of texts (9issas, WhatsApp non sensitive conversations, tweets, a blog or news website) then we need your help. 

### AI specialists
We also need AI specialists or researchers that can improve our algorithms.

### Data curators:
With large amounts of data, we may need help on curating it. Sometimes the task is simple as adding line returns at the end of sentences.
